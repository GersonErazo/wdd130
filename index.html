            <p>Hello everyone! I'm Gerson Isaac Erazo V√°squez, originally from El Salvador, currently residing in Salt Lake City, Utah. My journey led me to pursue Software Development, a passion I discovered during high school in my home country.In June 2022, I celebrated my wedding, and this 2024, I'm about to reach my two-year anniversary with my wife. Although we don't have children yet, we are excited about the future and starting a family.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies and family life, I am an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before settling in Utah, I had the privilege of serving on a mission in the Mexico Quer√©taro Mission. It was an incredible experience, full of challenges, but entirely worthwhile. So, in summary, my passion for software development, my commitment to marriage, my desire to start a family, and my connection to the Church have shaped my journey. I am excited about what the future holds in this new chapter of my life here in Salt Lake City.</p>
